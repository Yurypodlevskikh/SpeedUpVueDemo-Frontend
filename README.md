SpeedUp has been reorganized into a full-stack solution with frontend, backend, authentication and CI/CD.

# 🎵 SpeedUpVueDemo-Frontend

> **SpeedUp** is a smart metronome designed for musicians who want to develop consistent tempo control 
> and master difficult musical passages. It features a user-friendly interface, customizable settings, 
> and advanced metronome functionalities.
> This tool is especially useful for practicing difficult or complex passages in music,
> allowing musicians to gradually increase their speed and accuracy.

This is the **Vue 3 demo frontend** is shared for portfolio and recruitment purposes.
The core metronome engine logic has been intentionally removed to protect intellectual property.
